Overview
========

RMImageScroller is an image scroller for iOS 3.2 or later. It is typically used to show thumbnails for a sequential viewer. It supports iPhone, iPad and all screen orientations.

A sample project is included.

How to use
==========

1. Copy the contents of /Classes to your project. You will need both RMImageScroller and RMUIUtils (.h and .m).

2. Import "RMImageScroller.h" in the necessary files.

3. Provide a delegate for the scroller that conforms to the RMImageScrollerDelegate protocol defined in RMImageScroller.h. Refer to RMImageScrollerViewController of the sample project for an implementation example.

Sample
======

RMImageScrollerViewController uses RMViewController to show various thumbnails in spread mode. Tapping on an image displays it on the background.

Sample thumbnails from the most excellent comic Bear Beater Bunyan by Josh Hechinger & Jorge F. Mu–oz.
